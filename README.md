# Pitchify 🚀

Welcome to the **Pitchify**, the place where dreams (and a few ridiculous ideas) go to take flight! Whether you're a seasoned entrepreneur or someone who just had a lightbulb moment while brushing your teeth, this is the platform for you!

## What Is It? 🤔

Startup Idea Hub is a web platform that allows users to submit their brilliant (or not-so-brilliant) startup ideas and share them with the world. Who knows? Your half-baked concept could be the next big thing—or at least provide some laughs!

## Features 🎉

- **Submit Your Ideas**: Got a wild thought that could change the world? Or maybe just an idea for a dog-walking service that serves gourmet treats? Share it with us!
- **Browse Ideas**: Browse through a treasure trove of startup ideas. Some are gold, some are... well, let’s just say they need some work.

## How It Works 🔄

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account faster than you can say "unicorn startup."
2. **Submit Your Idea**: Fill out a simple form to share your brilliant idea. Be sure to include your best pitch—bonus points for humor!

## Getting Started 🛠️

    npm install

3. Start the server:

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the magic happen!
